# IeBHOExamples
A set of examples for building a managed Internet Explorer BHO.


#Warning
I highly discourage the use of managed code to write an Internet Explorer BHO. [I wrote a blog post](https://vcsjones.com/2012/09/03/regrets-managed-browser-helper-objects/)
discussing a few of the many reasons why I discourage it, and [others agree](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ieinternals/archive/2014/04/10/do-not-write-browser-extensions-toolbars-bhos-and-activex-in-managed-dotnet-code.aspx)
that managed code is not the correct choice.
